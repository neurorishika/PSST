In addition, this can be used to distribute computation to servers with powerful GPUs, and have other computations done on servers with more memory, and so on. Unfortunately, the official documentation on Distributed TensorFlow rather jumps in at the deep end. For a slightly more gentle introduction we will run through some really basic examples with Jupyter."
